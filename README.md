# The following code is meant to output several South African public holidays for the year 2050. I should log the name of the holiday, as well as the associated month. There is also a condition that only logs “Youth Day” if the current status is student and only “Christmas Day” if the status is “parent”. Once all the public holidays have been logged, the final output should log three separate messages each showing the following:

# The status value as declared initially (”parent”)
# The year as declared initially (2050)
# The total count of holidays for the above settings (9)
